Benchmarking different approaches to handle Symfony app
========================================================

I was curios on "how fast symfony app may be". That's why I prepared this demo stand to check performance of symfony
 apps using different approaches to serve requests. Right now there is:
 
  - PHP-FPM and Nginx as base line
  - UWSGI as Application Server
  - PHP-PM
